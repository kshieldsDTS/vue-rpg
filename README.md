# Unnamed Vue RPG

## Overview
My first attempt to build a Vue application from scratch, pulling ideas from my previous React Based RPG project. The React version was very bare bones and more of a proof of concept than anything else. I intend to make this version more robust, with character customization, leveling up, classes, and multiple party members as well as multiple enemies per encounter.

## Planned Features 
- Main Character
  - Customizable Name (Complete)
  - Customizable Class
  - Customizable Abilities
  - Customizable Stats
  - Level Up
- Party Members
  - Customizable Party Members
  - Non-Customizable Story Party Members
  - Level Up
- Inventory
  - Traditional slot system
  - Drag & Drop Interface
  - Filtering
  - Sorting
  - Tabs
  - Equipped Item Encumberance
- Combat
  - Multiple Enemies
  - Targeting
  - Non-traditional combat features
- Narrative
  - Type in options
  - Return to previous areas
- Codex
  - Game Help
  - Encylopedia of Known Items, Enemies, and Game Mechanics 
- Quality of Life
  - Save information to local storage or cache to continue playing
  - Save file system on machines
  - Save file system on DB with authentication

## Additional Features
- Hotkeys for Navigation, Inventory, Equipment, etc...
- GUI for visualizing enemies and the environment
- Sound effects for combat, narrative
- Crafting system
- More to follow...

## Game Logic
I plan to depart from using Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition rules at the core of the RPG and develop a new system. The logic will base around player stats, which will scale with their attacks. Some abilities, spells and items will scale better with some stats than others. Encounters (both non-combat and combat) will award experience, which in turn will allow characters to level up and raise their stats.
